<h2>Scrumy</h2>
<h3>Since June 2008</h3>

<p>
Scrumy is a startup that I and two friends co-founded in June 2008 as a full-time, and then part-time venture. Scrumy is a simple tool for Scrum project management. It seeks to replace a local team’s Scrum card wall without adding any more complexity than necessary. A Pro version of the tool allows teams to plan and track iterations, or “sprints”, as well as providing instant “push” updating for globally distributed teams.

Scrumy is a Ruby on Rails app. While I had a hand in the Rails side of things, my primary contribution to this project is the graphical and design work, as well as front-end coding. The HTML markup has been optimized to be small, the javascript is unobtrusive, and the CSS plays nice on all browsers. As was common at the time, the site uses the Prototype Javascript framework. Special care has been taken to exhibit a native feel across platforms. How about taking a look?
