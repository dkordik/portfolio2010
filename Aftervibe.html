<h2>Aftervibe</h2>
<h3>January 2008 - June 2008 (defunct)</h3>

<p>
Aftervibe was a startup that two friends and I co-founded in January 2008 as a full-time venture. Aftervibe was a storytelling platform that synchronized with Facebook Events, and had plans for additional event service integration. It consisted of a standalone website and a Facebook app, both which allowed you to collaboratively write stories about parties with your friends.
</p>
<p>
I did all of the graphical work on Aftervibe, including the logo, business cards, and interfaces for all pages on the site and facebook app.  I then implemented these designs with semantic HTML, CSS, sprites, and FBML. Aftervibe was a Ruby on Rails app.
</p>
Unfortunately Aftervibe is no longer live.
<p>However, you can look through these screenshots and imagine what it was like back then... <span style="font-size:80%">back then...</span> <span style="font-size:65%">back then...</span> <span style="font-size:50%">back then...</span>
