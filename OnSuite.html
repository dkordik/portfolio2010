On Rotation and On Deck are C# based Windows applications that leverage the Last.fm API. I created them out of a need for music management functions beyond the ability of any current music player. With their assitance, I am more easily able to consume a large volume of incoming music without being overwhelmed. Fewer albums go unlistened to, and more albums get enough rotation to stick. Both apps require Windows 7 (or the .NET Framework 3.5) and an active Last.fm account. Select a screenshot to go to the app's site.

<h4>On Rotation</h4>

<p>
On Rotation helps you track and replay the albums that you currently have on rotation. Selecting an album loads it into your media player of choice, or in Spotify. Drag and drop is supported for all known media players. Monitor mode adds your newly scrobbled albums when they show up on Last.fm.

<h4>On Deck</h4>

<p>
On Deck is the new music bin. It grabs your last 90 days of Last.fm history and shows albums that have yet to be heard. It displays the newest albums sorted by <em>creation date</em>, which surprisingly no music player on the market can do. This means that you are not bound to one media library's "date added", or a file's ever changing "date modified". Leave the app running to see an album the instant it hits your hard drive, through the power of filesystem hooks.

On Deck will also facilitate album art grabbing via my high res artwork finder, Def. Click an album without art and you'll be taken to a Def album search. Once you find the artwork you seek, drag it from your browser right into the proper On Deck album square. The file will be saved to the album's directory under its original filename and as folder.jpg.
