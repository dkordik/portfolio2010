<h2>The Black Market</h2>
<h3>Since July 2009</h3>

<p>
The Black Market is a simplified front-end for the iTunes Music Store. It allows you to check out the latest new releases without opening the bloated iTunes app and wading through all of the non-music things that now populate the iTunes store. You can listen to 30-second previews of songs, or click a relevant icon to listen to full tracks in Spotify or Grooveshark.

The site is designed/developed solely by me as a personal project for my own use. The backend is written in PHP5 consisting mainly of iTunes store parsing code and view code, and runs on Apache httpd with mod_rewrite for attractive URLs. The frontend consists of clean markup, CSS, vanilla Javascript for a few basic things, and recently, jQuery to replicate the large iTunes "stage" image sliders at the siteâ€™s top. All album and stage images are pulled in real-time from the iTunes store.
